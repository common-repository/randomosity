== Description ==

Quote yourself! In order to make best use of Randomosity, either define excerpts for all of your posts or add custom
fields to them and include the keys to those fields in the list of custom field types in Randomosity's options.

== Installation ==

To get up and running:

1. Upload `randomosity.php`, or a folder containing it, to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. If you don't already use excerpts, use the Excerpt or Randomosity fields to add them to your posts
1. Place `<?php randomosity(true); ?>` in your templates to display a formatted excerpt (or `false` for unformatted) 
1. Customize the formatting via the Randomosity options panel

Enjoy!
